# About This Module
This module was created for the **Archaeology Data Service**, based at the University of York, York, UK. It demonstrates FAIMS' capability to mint standalone APKs and deploy modules directly on Google Play without the need to connect to a FAIMS server. The module can help record cemeteries, burial plots, burial markers, and individual burials. It is a simplified version of the Gravestones module previously developed for Flinders University and serves for demonstration only.
